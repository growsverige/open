# The Emerging Battery Society

So we're starting to see a Battery Society emerge. 

There'll be a battery in pretty much every thing in your house. Not just cars and phones, but chairs and flower pots as well. 
The lamp above your head is a drone that lights up your room that moves to create the proper light conditions. It positions itself in sockets in the ceiling and flies down and recharges on it's own.
